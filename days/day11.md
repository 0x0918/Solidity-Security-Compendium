# Controlled Delegate Call
A controlled delegate call vulnerability in Solidity occurs when a contract uses the delegatecall opcode in an unsafe manner, allowing an attacker to control the target contract address or the function to be called. This can lead to unauthorized execution of functions, manipulation of contract state, or even complete takeover of the contract.

delegatecall is a low-level opcode that allows a contract to call another contract's function using its own storage context. The callee contract can read and write to the caller contract's storage, making it a powerful tool but also a potential security risk if not used correctly.

## Impact
The impact of controlled delegate call vulnerabilities includes:

1. Unauthorized execution of functions, potentially leading to theft of funds, manipulation of contract state, or other unintended consequences.
2. Complete contract takeover, giving the attacker control over the contract's functionality and stored assets.
3. Loss of user confidence in the contract, which may lead to reduced adoption or usage.

## Example
Consider a simple contract that allows anyone to delegate a call to another contract and has a balance of 100 ether:

In this example, the `execute` function accepts a target contract address and data as input parameters and performs a delegate call to the target. However, since there are no access controls or validation of the target and data, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to call any function in the contract, including those that were not meant to be callable.

Let's consider an attacker contract that exploits the controlled delegate call vulnerability.

Here's the Attacker contract:

The attack would work as follows:

1. The attacker sends 100 ether to the `DelegateCallProxy` contract.
2. The attacker deploys the Attacker contract to the network.
3. The attacker crafts a malicious payload to call the stealEther function of the Attacker contract using delegate call. This can be done by encoding the function signature.
4. The attacker calls the execute function of the `DelegateCallProxy` contract, passing the address of the Attacker contract and the malicious payload as arguments.
5. The `DelegateCallProxy` contract performs a delegate call to the Attacker contract, executing the stealEther function in the context of the DelegateCallProxy contract's storage.
6. The `stealEther` function transfers the DelegateCallProxy contract's balance (100 ether) to the attacker's address.

## Remediation
**Use access controls**: Implement access controls (e.g., function modifiers) to ensure that only authorized users can execute the delegate call.

**Validate the target contract**: Ensure that the target contract address is a trusted and verified contract before executing the delegate call.

**Avoid delegate calls when possible**: Consider using other mechanisms, such as the call opcode, which provides better isolation between contracts, or using higher-level abstractions like interfaces and contract inheritance.

To remediate the revised `DelegateCallProxy` contract, we can add access control mechanisms to restrict who can call the execute function. One way to do this is by using the Ownable pattern, as mentioned above, which allows only the owner of the contract to execute delegate calls.

Here's the remediated `DelegateCallProxy` contract:

Now, only the owner of the `DelegateCallProxy` contract can call the `execute` function, making it harder for an attacker to exploit the contract using the controlled delegate call vulnerability. However, it is still important to ensure that the owner of the contract carefully reviews the target contracts and data passed to the execute function to prevent malicious delegate calls.
